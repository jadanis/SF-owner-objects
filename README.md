# SF-owner-objects
An Apex class (Salesforce) for finding records owned by a user

The goal is to create a view for finding all objects owned by a given User in Salesforce. This is to help admins when someone leaves the company or various records (Leads, Opportunities, Contacts, Accounts, Tasks, etc.) need to be reassigned.
